# ReScript Bindings Stash

In this repo I put ReScript bindings that I haven't published as separate packages yet. Either because I haven't had the time, or because I bind to so little of the underlying package that it's not worth it.

You should **copy and paste** the bindings you need from here. Tailor them to your own use case! Feel free to do whatever you want with them. If you have improvements, open an issue and we can discuss whether it'd be good to create a dedicated bindings package for them.

**This is what you can expect from the bindings in this repo**:

- If they're in here they're used in production in some capacity
- More or less always incomplete (binds only to what has been needed)
- Not guaranteed to be 100% correct (although they _are_ used in prod, so they should work for the most case)
- Often opinionated
